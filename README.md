# Nnumpy-Challange
AnitaB Numpy Challenge

Problem 1: Create an integer identity matrix of size (5, 6). Print the Numpy array. 
Problem 2: Write a NumPy program to convert an array to a float type. Original array [1, 2, 3, 4] Array converted to a float type: [ 1. 2. 3. 4.] 
Problem 3 : Write a NumPy program to convert a list and tuple into arrays. 
Problem 4 : Create an integer array of size 10, where all the values should be 0 but the fifth value should be 1. 
Problem 5 : What will be the output --> np.random.rand() 
Problem 6 : Given an integer array of size 10 and replace the first occurrence of maximum value by 0? 
Problem 7 : Write a NumPy program to find the set difference of two arrays. (The set difference will return the sorted, unique values in array1 that are not in array2.) Expected Output: Array1: [ 0 10 20 40 60 80] Array2: [10, 30, 40, 50, 70, 90] Set difference between two arrays: [ 0 20 60 80] 
Problem 8 : Write a NumPy program to compute the determinant of a given square array. Problem 9 : Write a NumPy program to compute the inverse of a given matrix
